<p>
If a developer fails to add a break statement to the end of a switch-clause, then control flow "falls" into any following switch-clause.
Whilst this is sometimes intentional, it is often an error.

To ensure that such errors can be detected, the last statement in every switch-clause shall be a break statement,
or if the switch-clause is a compound statement, then the last statement in the compound statement shall be a break statement.

A special case exists if the switch-clause is empty, as this allows groups of clauses requiring identical statements to be created.

The following code snippet illustrates this rule:
</p>

<pre>
switch (param) {
  case 0: // Compliant
  case 1: // Compliant
    break;
  case 2: // Compliant
    return;
  case 3: // Compliant
    throw new Error();
  case 4: // Noncompliant
    doSomething();
  default: // Compliant - default does not require "break"
    doSomethingElse();
}
</pre>
